# Discrete Optimization examples using MiniZinc

During the Sabbatical i read the ["In pursuit of the Traveling Salesman"](https://www.amazon.com/Pursuit-Traveling-Salesman-Mathematics-Computation/dp/0691152705) and for my suprise i found out that performance of LP-solvers can be overwhelmingly better than some well-known heuristical solutions we are tought in our computer science classes;

I decided to dig deeper into the Discrete Optimization and it turned out be fun and very challenging;

This repository includes code examples from various discrete optimization book and solutions;
